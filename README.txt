quick vim guide:

when in doubt, press "Esc"


If the bottom line says --Insert--, you are in the text editor and can type.
Press Esc to get to the editor's version of a command line.  The insert mode at the bottom should disappear.  

Important commands to use if you want to escape this hell:

:help   	(Will pull up a pretty terrible documentation for vim)
:q!			(will force quit vim without saving any text entered or other changes)
:w 			(will save changes, but you are still in vim...)
:wq			(Will save the changes and grant you freedom. Seriously, use this if 
			you have a commit note that you have entered and don't know what to do to submit your changes)
